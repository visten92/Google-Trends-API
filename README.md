Google Trends is a tool provided by Google that allows users to see how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages. The tool also allows for comparison of search-terms, as well as viewing data over a specific period of time. Google Trends data is based on the total number of Google searches and is presented on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is the term with the most popularity. This tool can be used for a variety of purposes such as market research, SEO optimization, and monitoring brand popularity. Additionally, it can be used to identify trends, hot topics, and shifts in public opinion. The data can be visualized in various forms like line charts, maps and bar charts and can also be exported to CSV or Excel. Google Trends is available free of charge and can be accessed by visiting the website https://trends.google.com/trends/

In this project, we use the pytrends API, which is a Python wrapper for Google Trends API, to plot trend metrics of a specific key phrase over a specific time range. The pytrends API allows us to programmatically access the same data that is available on the Google Trends website, but with the added convenience of being able to retrieve and process the data using Python. The API allows us to specify the key phrase, the time range, and the geographic region for which we want to retrieve data. We can also retrieve data for multiple key phrases and compare their trend metrics. Additionally, pytrends API allows us to plot the trend metrics with various visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn and also export the data to a CSV or Excel file. This project uses pytrends API to extract insights from the Google trends data and can be useful for various purposes such as market research, SEO optimization, and monitoring brand popularity.
